    <h1>We are Saying Goodbye but our Legacy of Global Humanitarian Achievements Continues With Your Good Work.</h1>
    <h6><p>Fourteen years ago Souktel was born out of a belief that technology could help produce better outcomes and lives for vulnerable populations around the globe.</p>
    <p>We at Souktel, heard the call and rose to the challenges with you - our business partners - to create innovative technology to improve lives. Be it in healthcare, education and entrepreneurship, our custom digital designs paired with our partners in humanitarian endeavors, made a difference and will continue to do so.</p>   
    <p>We were blessed to build a team with a can-do spirit of cross-border communication and a work ethic that built enduring partnerships with communities in many countries. With an R&D hub in Ramallah, Palestine, partners in many countries, and a small headquarters in the US, we worked remotely long before any pandemic forced this style of work onto our lives.</p>   
    <p>So, as a decline in our business requires us to close this chapter of Souktel, we thank you for your business over the years and we wish you all good health and hope you keep alive the spirit and outreach of your work to make us all better global citizens.</p>
